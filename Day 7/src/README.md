### Day 7: Arrays
**Objective:** </br>
Today, we will learn about the Array data structure.

**Task:** </br>
Given an array, A, of N integers, print A's elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

**Example:** </br>
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Print 4 3 2 1. Each integer is separated by one space.

**Input Format:** </br>

The first line contains an integer, N (the size of our array).
The second line contains N space-separated integers that describe array A's elements.

**Constraints:** </br>

- 1 <= N <= 1000
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10000, where  is the  integer in the array.

**Output Format:** </br>

Print the elements of array  in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

**Sample Input:** </br>
4 </br>
1 4 3 2

**Sample Output:** </br>
2 3 4 1
